NOTES:

This asssignment works with all the included tests

However, there are some things things that I was not able to get to/Check
I was not able to confirm that I implemented the timeouts correctly.
I was not able to fully refactor my code into neat blocks and functions
I was not able to confirm that I implemented SREJ the correct way

Also, I do not know what is a reasonable runtime for any given parameters.
So a little benchmark of my program is:

    5 paragraphs of lorem ipsum on 0.4 error percent on both rcopy and server takes about 15 seconds
    10 paragraphs of lorem ipsum on 0.4 error percent on both rcopy and server takes about 30 seconds

Once error percent rate is 0.5 or greater, my program takes a while to run.
This is probably due to my timeout implementation.

Also, for some reason, my rcopy cannot get pass the sending bufferSize state when trying to rcopy a
second time on the same server.
